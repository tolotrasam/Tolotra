This is a plugin that allows you to annotate WooCommerce product on top of any image and display those images as custom posts or embed them within other existing posts.


== Description ==

If you want to add more value to your WooCommerce site by giving more reasons for your customers to buy your product, this plugin is right for you. It will allow you to extend the way you expose your product through annotation of those products in live pictures.

Best of all, this plugin is accompanied with a friendly and responsive user interface for both the frontend and the backend sides. You can annotate, save, display your image, then go back and edit it by adding different products on top of your image.
